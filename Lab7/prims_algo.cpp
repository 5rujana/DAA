/*The algorithm starts with an empty spanning tree. 
The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices. 
The first set contains the vertices already included in the MST,
 and the other set contains the vertices not yet included.
At every step, it considers all the edges that connect the two sets
and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges.
After picking the edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST. */



/* A group of edges that connects two sets of vertices in a graph is called cut in graph theory.
 So, at every step of Primâ€™s algorithm, find a cut, pick the minimum weight edge from the cut, 
 and include this vertex in MST Set (the set that contains already included vertices). */
